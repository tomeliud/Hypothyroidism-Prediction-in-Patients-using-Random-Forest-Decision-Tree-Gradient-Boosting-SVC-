# Hypothyroidism-Prediction-in-Patients-using-Random-Forest-Decision-Tree-Gradient-Boosting-SVC-
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Am tasked with building a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.
